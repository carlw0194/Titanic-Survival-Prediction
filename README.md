# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about passengers such as their age, sex, class, and whether or not they survived. 
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about passengers such as their age, sex, class, and whether or not they survived.

## Project Overview
The project includes the following steps:

Data preprocessing: handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical.
Exploratory data analysis: visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
Feature scaling: scaling numerical features using the standard scaler.
Model training and evaluation: training a logistic regression model and evaluating its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Making predictions: using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
